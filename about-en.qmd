The author’s thoughts are influenced by both classical Islamic thought and Western philosophy. In particular:

- **Bediüzzaman Said Nursî**’s efforts to establish a relationship between faith and science,

- In the West, especially the empiricist philosophers’ knowledge- and observation-centered approaches, as well as the Logical Empiricists’ attempts to clarify the linguistic and logical structure of scientific statements,

stand out as key sources of inspiration.
